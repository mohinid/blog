Integrating React with Rails 7 is a powerful way to combine the robust backend capabilities of Rails with the interactive frontend features of React. In this blog, I'll walk you through the steps to integrate React into your Rails 7 application using `@rails/webpacker` and other commands.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

1. Ruby installed
2. Rails 7 installed
3. Node.js and npm installed
4. Yarn installed (`npm install -g yarn`)
