Hey everyone! Hope your Autumn days are filled with fun and adventure apart from the mindboggling work you are doing and the warm smell of Coffee!

Lately, everyone has been asking me (especially in the interviews) why I switched from a QA Lead role to Software Development and how my journey has been over these couple of years. And My Oh My! It does feel like starting from Zero but it has been worth more than what I expected... So here is my story!

I started my tech journey as a QA, a role that I didn’t exactly choose. It came through campus placement, and like anyone eager to succeed, I gave it my all and excelled at it. I eventually became a QA Lead, managing multiple projects, clients and releases simultaneously. But after 6 years, I felt stuck in the role and soon it was time for a change.

At that point, I had two options:
- Move up to a Tech Manager role,
- Or take a leap into something that truly inspired me. 

Since I was already working with Ruby on Rails apps for Integration and Performance testing, <b>I found myself curious and motivated to dig deeper and step into building these big systems.<b>

### Getting the Right Support for the Switch
I knew this wasn’t something I could do alone, so I asked for help. My manager at [Saeloun](https://www.saeloun.com/), Vipul, and Sonam were incredibly supportive, giving me the guidance and mentorship I needed to start transitioning. They provided me with the time and tasks to learn and grow, and soon enough, I was working on backend APIs, database optimization, scripts and [blogs](https://blog.saeloun.com/authors/mohini/)! I may have started with small steps, but each one brought me closer to being a full-fledged developer.

I’m especially grateful to Shrinath and Romil, my mentors at [DirectShifts](https://www.directshifts.com/), for their constant support in making this process smooth and successful.

### What I’ve Learned and What’s Next
Since making the switch, I’ve learned and accomplished so much more than I initially thought possible. The excitement of solving problems through code and seeing things come to life has been incredibly rewarding - especially at DirectShifts, where each change has significantly impacted the clients and internal users!

<b>Looking ahead, I want to build apps that impact millions, deep dive into future tech, and continue creating things that make a difference.<b>

I recently came across this awesome quote by Chris Williamson:

<h2 style="color: midnightblue;">"The Magic that you are looking for is in the work you are avoiding!"</h2>

In the end, life’s all about growth, exploration, and jumping into the next big adventure, right?
Cheers to challenges, and building a better future, <b>one line of code at a time!<b>
