# Ruby Best Practices: Writing Clean, Maintainable, and Efficient Code

Ruby is known for its elegant syntax and developer-friendly features. However, writing clean, maintainable, and efficient Ruby code requires adhering to best practices. In this guide, weâ€™ll cover essential Ruby best practices, including naming conventions, method structuring, exception handling, and using tools like **RuboCop** to enforce coding standards.

---
## 1. Follow Proper Naming Conventions
Ruby has clear naming conventions that improve code readability:

- **Classes & Modules:** Use `CamelCase` (e.g., `UserProfile`, `PaymentGateway`)
- **Methods & Variables:** Use `snake_case` (e.g., `calculate_total`, `user_id`)
- **Constants:** Use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `API_KEY`, `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`)
- **Booleans:** Use predicate method names ending in `?` (e.g., `valid?`, `empty?`)
- **Bang Methods (`!`)**: Use `!` for methods that modify the object (e.g., `save!`, `update!`)

Example:
```ruby
class OrderProcessor  # CamelCase for class names
  DEFAULT_TAX_RATE = 0.05  # SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants
  
  def calculate_total(price, tax_rate = DEFAULT_TAX_RATE)  # snake_case for methods
    price + (price * tax_rate)
  end
end
```

---
## 2. Keep Methods Short and Focused
Each method should perform a **single responsibility**. If a method does too much, consider breaking it down into smaller helper methods.

**Bad:**
```ruby
def process_order(order)
  validate_order(order)
  apply_discounts(order)
  charge_payment(order)
  send_confirmation_email(order)
end
```

**Good:**
```ruby
def process_order(order)
  validate(order)
  apply_discounts(order)
  charge(order)
  notify_user(order)
end
```
Each of these smaller methods does one thing, making the code easier to test and maintain.

---
## 3. Use Symbols Instead of Strings for Hash Keys
Symbols are more memory-efficient than strings when used as hash keys.

**Bad:**
```ruby
user = { "name" => "Alice", "age" => 30 }
puts user["name"]
```

**Good:**
```ruby
user = { name: "Alice", age: 30 }
puts user[:name]
```

---
## 4. Use `each` Instead of `for`
Avoid using `for` loops in Ruby; prefer `each`, which is more idiomatic.

**Bad:**
```ruby
for num in [1, 2, 3] do
  puts num
end
```

**Good:**
```ruby
[1, 2, 3].each { |num| puts num }
```

---
## 5. Prefer `map` Over `each` for Transformations
If you are transforming an array, use `map` instead of `each`.

**Bad:**
```ruby
squared_numbers = []
[1, 2, 3].each { |n| squared_numbers << n**2 }
```

**Good:**
```ruby
squared_numbers = [1, 2, 3].map { |n| n**2 }
```

---
## 6. Use Safe Navigation Operator (`&.`) to Avoid `nil` Errors
Instead of checking `nil?` manually, use `&.`.

**Bad:**
```ruby
email = user && user.profile && user.profile.email
```

**Good:**
```ruby
email = user&.profile&.email
```

---
## 7. Use `begin...rescue` for Exception Handling

**Bad:**
```ruby
def fetch_data
  response = external_api_call
  response[:data]
rescue StandardError
  puts "An error occurred"
end
```

**Good:**
```ruby
def fetch_data
  response = external_api_call
  response[:data]
rescue StandardError => e
  puts "Error: #{e.message}"
end
```
Using `rescue StandardError => e` helps track errors with more clarity.

---
## 8. Use Lambdas for Short, Reusable Blocks
Lambdas are great for defining short functions.

**Bad:**
```ruby
def double(n)
  n * 2
end

puts double(5)
```

**Good:**
```ruby
double = ->(n) { n * 2 }
puts double.call(5)
```
Lambdas are useful when passing behavior as an argument to methods.

---
## 9. Use `RuboCop` to Enforce Coding Standards
[RuboCop](https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop) is a Ruby linter that enforces best practices automatically.

To install:
```sh
gem install rubocop
```
To check your code:
```sh
rubocop my_file.rb
```
It suggests improvements and helps keep your code consistent.

---
## 10. Prefer `freeze` for Immutable Constants
Prevent accidental modification of constants using `freeze`.

**Bad:**
```ruby
CURRENCIES = ["USD", "EUR", "GBP"]
CURRENCIES << "JPY"
```

**Good:**
```ruby
CURRENCIES = ["USD", "EUR", "GBP"].freeze
```

---
## Conclusion
By following these best practices, you can write **clean, efficient, and maintainable** Ruby code. Using tools like **RuboCop**, keeping methods small, using idiomatic syntax, and leveraging **lambdas** can make a significant difference in code quality.
