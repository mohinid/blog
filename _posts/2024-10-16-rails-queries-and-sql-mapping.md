In SQL, queries can be categorized into five types based on their purpose: **DDL (Data Definition Language)**, **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**, **DQL (Data Query Language)**, **DCL (Data Control Language)**, and **TCL (Transaction Control Language)**. Let's explore each with its corresponding operations and their equivalents in Ruby on Rails using Active Record.

</p>

### 1. **DDL (Data Definition Language)**
DDL is used to define and manage database schema, such as creating or modifying tables, indexes, and constraints.

#### Common SQL Commands:
- `CREATE`: Create new database objects (e.g., tables, indexes).
- `ALTER`: Modify existing database objects (e.g., adding a new column).
- `DROP`: Delete database objects (e.g., tables, indexes).

#### Rails Equivalents:
In Rails, these operations are typically handled using **migrations**.

**Example of DDL in SQL:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  email VARCHAR(100)
);
```

**Rails Migration for Creating a Table:**
```ruby
class CreateUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.0]
  def change
    create_table :users do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.string :email
      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```

**Example of modifying a table (SQL `ALTER`):**
```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN age INT;
```

**Rails Migration for Modifying a Table:**
```ruby
class AddAgeToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.0]
  def change
    add_column :users, :age, :integer
  end
end
```


### 2. **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**
DML is used to manipulate the data inside the tables, including inserting, updating, and deleting records.

#### Common SQL Commands:
- `INSERT`: Add new records.
- `UPDATE`: Modify existing records.
- `DELETE`: Remove records.

#### Rails Equivalents:
In Rails, these operations are handled by Active Record methods like `create`, `update`, and `destroy`.

**Example of DML in SQL (`INSERT`):**
```sql
INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('John Doe', 'john@example.com');
```

**Rails Active Record Equivalent for Creating a Record:**
```ruby
User.create(name: 'John Doe', email: 'john@example.com')
```

**Example of DML in SQL (`UPDATE`):**
```sql
UPDATE users SET email = 'newemail@example.com' WHERE id = 1;
```

**Rails Active Record Equivalent for Updating a Record:**
```ruby
user = User.find(1)
user.update(email: 'newemail@example.com')
```

**Example of DML in SQL (`DELETE`):**
```sql
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1;
```

**Rails Active Record Equivalent for Deleting a Record:**
```ruby
User.find(1).destroy
```


### 3. **DQL (Data Query Language)**
DQL is primarily used for querying data from the database. The most common DQL command is `SELECT`.

#### Common SQL Commands:
- `SELECT`: Retrieve data from one or more tables.

#### Rails Equivalents:
In Rails, querying data is handled using Active Record methods like `where`, `select`, `find`, etc.

**Example of DQL in SQL (`SELECT`):**
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'John Doe';
```

**Rails Active Record Equivalent for Querying Data:**
```ruby
User.where(name: 'John Doe')
```

**Example of DQL in SQL (`SELECT` with specific columns):**
```sql
SELECT name, email FROM users WHERE age > 25;
```

**Rails Active Record Equivalent for Selecting Specific Columns:**
```ruby
User.where('age > ?', 25).select(:name, :email)
```
### SQL JOINS

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/img/joins.jpg" alt="sql-joins" />
</p>

In SQL, **joins** are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. There are different types of joins, and they are all part of **Data Query Language (DQL)** as they are used for querying data. Let's explore the most common types of joins and their equivalents in Rails using **Active Record**.

### A. **INNER JOIN**
An **INNER JOIN** returns records that have matching values in both tables. It filters out rows that do not match the condition.

#### SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT users.name, orders.amount
FROM users
INNER JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id;
```

#### Rails Active Record Equivalent:
```ruby
User.joins(:orders).select('users.name, orders.amount')
```

#### Explanation:
- The SQL query joins the `users` and `orders` tables based on the `user_id` column in the `orders` table.
- In Rails, the `joins` method is used to create an inner join. You specify the associated table (`:orders`), and you can use `select` to fetch specific columns.

### B. **LEFT OUTER JOIN (or LEFT JOIN)**
A **LEFT JOIN** returns all records from the left table (`users`), and the matched records from the right table (`orders`). If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the right table.

#### SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT users.name, orders.amount
FROM users
LEFT JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id;
```

#### Rails Active Record Equivalent:
```ruby
User.left_joins(:orders).select('users.name, orders.amount')
```

#### Explanation:
- The SQL query returns all users, including those who do not have any associated orders (with `NULL` values for `orders.amount`).
- In Rails, `left_joins` is used to create a left join.

### C. **RIGHT OUTER JOIN (or RIGHT JOIN)**
A **RIGHT JOIN** is similar to a **LEFT JOIN**, but it returns all records from the right table (`orders`), and the matched records from the left table (`users`). If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the left table.

#### SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT users.name, orders.amount
FROM users
RIGHT JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id;
```

#### Rails Active Record Equivalent:
Active Record does not directly support `RIGHT JOIN`, but you can use raw SQL for this.

```ruby
User.joins('RIGHT JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id').select('users.name, orders.amount')
```

### D. **FULL OUTER JOIN**
A **FULL OUTER JOIN** returns all records when there is a match in either the left (`users`) or right (`orders`) table. Rows without a match in one of the tables will return `NULL` for the columns from the other table.

#### SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT users.name, orders.amount
FROM users
FULL OUTER JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id;
```

#### Rails Active Record Equivalent:
Active Record doesn't support `FULL OUTER JOIN` out of the box, so you can use raw SQL.

```ruby
User.joins('FULL OUTER JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id').select('users.name, orders.amount')
```

### E. **CROSS JOIN**
A **CROSS JOIN** returns the Cartesian product of the two tables, i.e., all possible combinations of rows between the two tables.

#### SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT users.name, orders.amount
FROM users
CROSS JOIN orders;
```

#### Rails Active Record Equivalent:
For cross joins, you can use raw SQL in Rails as well.

```ruby
User.joins('CROSS JOIN orders').select('users.name, orders.amount')
```

### F. **SELF JOIN**
A **SELF JOIN** is used to join a table to itself. This is useful in hierarchical relationships, such as when employees have managers who are also employees.

#### SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT e1.name AS employee, e2.name AS manager
FROM employees e1
JOIN employees e2 ON e1.manager_id = e2.id;
```

#### Rails Active Record Equivalent:
```ruby
Employee.joins("INNER JOIN employees managers ON employees.manager_id = managers.id")
        .select('employees.name AS employee, managers.name AS manager')
```

### G. **NATURAL JOIN**
A **NATURAL JOIN** automatically joins tables based on columns with the same name and data type in both tables. It avoids specifying a specific condition but joins the tables using the natural relationship between them.

#### SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT users.name, orders.amount
FROM users
NATURAL JOIN orders;
```

#### Rails Active Record Equivalent:
Rails does not support **NATURAL JOIN** natively, but you can use raw SQL.

```ruby
User.joins('NATURAL JOIN orders').select('users.name, orders.amount')
```

In Rails, Active Record provides a convenient interface for most common SQL joins, and for more complex queries like **FULL JOIN**, **RIGHT JOIN**, and **CROSS JOIN**, raw SQL can be used within Active Record methods.

### 4. **DCL (Data Control Language)**
DCL is used to control access to the data in the database. It is concerned with permissions and access control.

#### Common SQL Commands:
- `GRANT`: Grant access rights.
- `REVOKE`: Remove access rights.

#### Rails Equivalents:
Rails does not directly handle database-level permissions; this is typically done at the database level using SQL. However, you can control user permissions and authorization using gems like **Pundit** or **CanCanCan** in Rails for application-level access control.

**Example of DCL in SQL (`GRANT`):**
```sql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON users TO 'someuser';
```

**Example of DCL in SQL (`REVOKE`):**
```sql
REVOKE INSERT ON users FROM 'someuser';
```

</p>

### 5. **TCL (Transaction Control Language)**
TCL is used to control the execution of transactions. It ensures that a series of operations either complete successfully or fail together.

#### Common SQL Commands:
- `BEGIN`: Start a transaction.
- `COMMIT`: Save the changes made in the transaction.
- `ROLLBACK`: Undo the changes if thereâ€™s an error in the transaction.

#### Rails Equivalents:
In Rails, you can use Active Record's `transaction` method to manage transactions.

**Example of TCL in SQL (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`):**
```sql
BEGIN;
UPDATE users SET name = 'Jane Doe' WHERE id = 1;
DELETE FROM orders WHERE user_id = 1;
COMMIT;
```

**Rails Active Record Equivalent for Transaction Handling:**
```ruby
User.transaction do
  user = User.find(1)
  user.update(name: 'Jane Doe')
  Order.where(user_id: user.id).destroy_all
end
```

If an exception occurs, the transaction will be rolled back automatically.

### Summary

- **DDL (Data Definition Language)** handles schema changes like creating, altering, or dropping tables. In Rails, this is done using migrations.
- **DML (Data Manipulation Language)** is for inserting, updating, and deleting records. Rails provides methods like `create`, `update`, and `destroy`.
- **DQL (Data Query Language)** is for querying data. Active Recordâ€™s `where`, `find`, and `select` methods are the Rails equivalents.
- **DCL (Data Control Language)** controls permissions, though in Rails, this is handled by gems for authorization like Pundit or CanCanCan.
- **TCL (Transaction Control Language)** controls transactions, and in Rails, Active Record's `transaction` method manages these operations.

This classification helps you understand the roles of various SQL queries and how they map to Railsâ€™ Active Record, making your database operations in Rails seamless and easy to manage.
